# Elucify

Ask Claude Code to explain anything, and watch the explanation build itself in your browser: a narrated, animated
walkthrough with diagrams, tables, graphs and code, playing while Claude is still writing it. Share it with a link.

Elucify is in a free beta. It runs on a hosted service: sign in with Google, or continue without an account.
Website: https://elucify.dev

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add oneryalcin/elucify
/plugin install elucify@elucify
```

Then sign in once: run `/mcp`, choose **elucify** and **Authenticate**. A browser page opens: choose **Continue with
Google** (5 hours of narration a month, and your explanations at https://elucify.dev/account) or **Continue without an
account** (10 minutes a month). Claude Code keeps the sign-in, in the terminal, the desktop app and IDE extensions
alike.

Nothing else is needed: no key, no checkout, no local server, no voice model.

If Claude says elucify needs authentication, or the sign-in expired, run `/mcp` and Authenticate again.

## Use

```
/elucify:explain how a hash table finds a key
```

Or just ask Claude to explain something visually. Claude shows your link first; open it and the explanation
plays as each part is ready. Ask Claude to share it to get a separate link you can send to anyone, and to revoke that
link when you want. A finished explanation has an **Export video** button (Chrome or Edge) that downloads an MP4.

Signed in with Google, you can see all your explanations at https://elucify.dev/account: create, copy or withdraw share
links, delete explanations, and check your narration minutes.

## Good to know

- **Links are secret, not private.** Anyone who has a link can watch, without signing in, and nobody can guess one.
  Keep the first link Claude gives you to yourself: it can't be withdrawn. To show other people, ask Claude to share
  the explanation; that gives a separate link you can revoke at any time.
- **Limits in the beta.** Each explanation runs up to 3 minutes. Narration is 5 hours a month with Google, or 10
  minutes without an account. When narration runs out, explanations still play, with captions.
- **Audio is kept for 90 days after the last view** (30 days without an account). After that the explanation still
  plays, with captions.
- **Without an account, signing in again** (for example after `/mcp` → Authenticate) starts a new, separate creator:
  explanations made before still play from their links, but Claude can't add to them. Signing in with Google later,
  from the same browser within 30 days, moves them into your account. With Google, signing in again is always the same
  account.

## Coming from Chalkify

Elucify was called Chalkify until 2026-10-08. Remove the old plugin and install this one, then sign in once:

```
/plugin uninstall chalkify@chalkify
/plugin marketplace add oneryalcin/elucify
/plugin install elucify@elucify
```

Explanations made before the rename were on the old address and no longer open.
